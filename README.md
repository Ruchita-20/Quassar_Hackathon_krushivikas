# Krushivikas

Farmers face uncertainties in crop yield due to various factors such as weather conditions, soil quality, pest infestations, and management practices. Predicting crop yields accurately is crucial for farmers to make informed decisions regarding crop selection, resource allocation, and marketing strategies. Traditional methods of crop yield prediction often lack accuracy and scalability, hindering farmers' ability to optimize agricultural productivity and profitability. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and reliable crop yield prediction system that leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to provide accurate forecasts and support sustainable farming practices.
